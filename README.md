# Organizing principle: "Micro-motives of macro-behavior" (stolen from T. Schelling)
A Python-based course on Complexity Economics

Need to figure out a way to incorporate ScalABM to some extent. Possibly have some web applictation running interesting model on AWS that students can interact. Fabulous opportunity to build user community...

## Topics
First attempt to list a broad set of topics that we would like to cover during the course. *These topics are not listed in any particular order*!

### Power laws

### Financial markets
Lot's of previous work by Doyne and co-conspirators...

* SFI Stock market 
* Expectations formation processes

### Growth and Innovation

* Increasing returns and path dependence (B. Arthur)
* Contrast complexity approach with Solow model.

### Businesss Cycles
For me, key papers in business cycles are...

* X. Gabaix, *Granular origins of aggregate fluctuations.*
* D. Acemoglu et al, *Network origins of aggregate fluctuations.*

...these papers are too technical for our target audience.  Can we find a way to simplify the presentation of the key ingredients?

Possible ties to older business cycles literature. Models with "Predator-prey" dynamics.

### Inequality
Sugscape-esque simulations to demonstrate conditions for skewed distributions of wealth.  Can be tied  to Edgeworth Box diagrams.  Contrast the robustness of the first welfare theorem, with the fragility of the second welfare theorem.


### Behavioral Economics
Tons of material to cover her...

* Bounded rationality (H. Simon and descendents!)
* Learning

## Methods

### ABM

### Data Science/Machine Learning approaches

### Networks

### Dynamical Systems

### Stochastic processes

### Game Theory
